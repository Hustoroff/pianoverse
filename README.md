### Script for adding a custom background to the [Pianoverse](https://pianoverse.net/)!
- The **`URL`** of the image is required to embed the wallpaper.
- Possibility to hide wallpapers using a switch in the script menu.
- The wallpaper can be adjusted vertically as well as the area of the wallpaper space.
- It is recommended to use a wallpaper that matches the format of the area (`16:9`, `21:9` etc) to be inserted as well as the resolution of your monitor (`1920x1080`, `3440x1440` etc).
- This script adds wallpapers for the client side only (this means that other users will not see your wallpapers)!
